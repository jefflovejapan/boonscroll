# Middleware

- How does FileMiddleware expose the contents of the public directory?
- What's happening if I don't enable FileMiddleware? How am I able to serve individual files? Or is it just that I'm reading the file and responding with a string?

## Plan

- Quit fumbling around, actually read the Vapor docs
